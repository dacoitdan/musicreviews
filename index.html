	                        <p>
								We expect music journalists them to evaluate and listen to albums independently of outside influences and deliver their own honest judgment, but that is a difficult standard for any writer to be held to. 
							</p><p>
								How similar are music journalist’s preferences to each other? Do music journalists favor the same albums or the same kinds of albums?
							</p><p>
								Understanding this phenomenon will help music fans elucidate whether the recommendations they receive are influenced by the industry or by the genuine preferences of the reviewers. These findings can also help social scientists better understand how social affiliation and the recommendations and networks of experts can shape our preferences.
							</p>

							<h2>THEORY</h2>
							<p>
								The main social science concept that underpins this study is that of homophily, or the tendency of individuals to associate with other like-minded individuals. Homophily is related to the network analysis concept of assortativity, or the tendency of like nodes to connect. 
							</p><p>
								In this case, we are examining a group of music journalists working on a genre and seeing whether their preferences display a relatively high degree of overlap, or if they have distinct preferences.
							</p>
							
							<h2>HYPOTHESIS</h2>
							<p>
								We would expect these publications to have significant agreement in their sentiments with regards to these albums, as these albums are the 10 most critically acclaimed albums of 2016 as per Metacritic. 
							</p>

							<h2>RESEARCH DESIGN</h2>
							<p>
								My data will include ratings and reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian, SPIN, Rolling Stone, and The AV Club. I selected these publication as they all had ratings systems that were easily systematized into a numerical index. 
							</p><p>
								The main issue with these data is that they are a non-random sample. My sample of publications was chosen based on whether they would be easy to compare to each other. 
							</p><p>
								I will test my hypothesis by examining how each publication’s review reacted to a set of popular albums released in 2016. The albums in question were selected randomly from the highest rated albums from 2016 on Metacritic.
							</p><p>
								By using sentiment analysis of the review text along with the numerical ratings to standardize how they felt, we can see how well these publications agreed with each other. Even if they gave similar ratings, the different authors may express varying degrees of positive or negative sentiment.

							</table>
							<p>
								There were very few effects that had a high p, although with a small number of publications looked at I was more interested to see if there was a strong effect, indicating a lot of change with change in sentiment.
							</p><p>
								Only a few albums showed a significant change in sentiment with a change in rating, although with this style of sentiment analysis this could reflect a lot of different things.
							</p>

							<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
							<p>
								With a lack of significant patterns, we can conclude minimal homophily between these writers. The prevailing sentiment on an album does not seem to shape how music writers rate or feel about the top ten rated albums from 2016 on Metacritic.
